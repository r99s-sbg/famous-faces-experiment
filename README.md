Famous Faces Experiment

This repository contains the code for a "Famous Faces Experiment." The goal of this project is to present participants with a sequence of famous and non-famous faces, measure reaction times, and analyze the results.

Description
The experiment is structured as follows:

A fixation cross is displayed on the screen.
A noisy square appears for a jittered duration.
A random face (famous or non-famous) is briefly presented.
The participant responds using a button, and the reaction time (RT) is recorded.
The code also includes the functionality to:

Repeat the experiment for multiple trials.
Calculate the average reaction time over 50 trials.

Current Issues
Unfortunately, the PsychToolbox library stopped working on my computer during development.
While the logic of the code has been implemented, I couldn't fully test the experiment on my machine due to technical issues with Matlab/PsychToolBox.
